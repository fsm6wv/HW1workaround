## To Run

[Firstly,open the terminal and use the "./gradlew build" command to build your jar file. It will be in your libs folder within the build folder. 
To run the file use the command java -jar and then specify the filepath to the jar file followed by the path to the desired csv file. Another
option is to use the cd command until you reach the folder where the jar and/or csv file is and then just write the names of hte files. An
example of a command line code is "java -jar Apportionment.jar example_input.csv". Running this command will print an alphabetically sorted list
of all the states in the file and the # of representatives allocated to each one of them.]
